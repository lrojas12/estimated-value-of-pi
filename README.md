The objective of this assignment was to calculate an estimated value of pi using both a threaded and a non-threaded time-bounded simulation. In order to achieve this, the Monte Carlo program was implemented

*Note that, on the report, there is a typo: in the second like of the document, it should read*  ***"... both a <u>threaded</u> and a non-threaded time-bounded simulation."***
